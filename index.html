                        My name is Drew MacEachern. I live in Nova Scotia, Canada. I have lived here for almost 4 years, after moving from Ontario when I was 14. I was born in Mississauga, and moved to Ottawa when I was 3. My mother is a Major in the air force and works as a bioscience officer with the navy. My father started his own recruitment firm shortly after moving to Nova Scotia. I have 4 younger sisters. I live on a farm and we always have a lot of animals. We have 3 dogs and a cat, and this year we had 2 litters of kittens. We also have a cow, 3 pigs and 6 chickens. We have had many animals, from goats to sheep to pheasants.
                        I graduated highschool in 2024 and started at NSCC that same fall. I enjoy fishing and riding atvs. I also love music and photography, and I have been enjoying my time learning web programming!
